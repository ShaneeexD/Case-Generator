Custom Case Generator
=
This tool allows you to create custom cases for SOD using piepieonline's mod which can be found [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/shadows-of-doubt/p/Piepieonline/CommunityCaseLoader/).

It's fully functional but will be heavily refactored and updated in the future for optimization and better layout as it was done on the fly, possibly as a fresh new project completely.

Please let me know if you find any bugs and I will try to fix them asap.

Currently working on finishing the tool tips.

NOTE: Windows Defender may pick this up as a virus (it does for me), you may need to make an exclusion, the source code is available for you to see though
